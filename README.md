Issues
Throughout the project, I struggled in figuring out exactly if my html set up was done the best way possible. After watching the recordings, I found myself trying to simply do it as what was shown rather than taking that and applying the concepts to my own case. Once I slowly started changing things from how it was shown in the recording, the project started coming together more.
